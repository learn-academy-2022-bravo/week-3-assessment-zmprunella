# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I am not entirely sure but I think that "this" is a part of react that can be used in Javascript. I think it may involve using functions. 

  Researched answer: "This" is a key word in javascript that refers to an object. It is used in a function to show where to get value or data from. 



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a javascript Library. You would use it to access a larger ammount of keyword and abilities that you wouldn't be able to do normally in JS.

  Researched answer: Created by FaceBook, React is a front-end JS libray that is free and open source. It is used to build user interfaces based on UI components.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Not entirely sure what a lifecycle method is, would have to review some notes and do some more research. 

  Researched answer: The only method required in a class component is the Render() Method.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I am not sure. I would guess that it has to do with not knowing something about a particular function.

  Researched answer: It is a function with no name. Declared without any identifier.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: In react, it allows users to render different elements or components based on a condition. 

2. Object-oriented programming: is a programming model that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions or logic. I'm guessing this is the direction of "Ruby" "Backend" opposed to JS front end.

3. Ruby:is an open source, object oriented programming language. It is general purpose, interpereted and dynamically- typed, server side scripting language.

4. Ruby blocks: are small anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. They are inclosed in a do / end statment or between brackets and can have multiple arguments.

5. Ruby hashes: A hash is a colllection of unqiue keys and thier values.
